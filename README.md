# mentored_research2022
All of the code from my research project from the Fall 2022, using SKU data from Awatunai in Indonesia to forecast particular SKU's.
There is no 'one size fits all' time-series forecasting method for any data, so here I try to examine which methods are best (from the ones I could get to run) for forecasting random walk time series forecasts.

Here you will find Jupyter notebooks and .Rmd files where I tried methods and failed, and others where my succesful work is showcased! If you have any questions about my code, email me at carson.slater@my.wheaton.edu.


Iteration I is the first iteration of my project.

Iteration II is the second, where I am making a poster for the UIC 2022 Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium.
